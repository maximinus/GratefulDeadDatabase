Order of things to do

*: Finish all years shows
*: Get the venue data for all 77/78 shows

Put everything we have (song, shows, venues, sets) into a database

Write code to get weather, first by finding the next show to grab.
    Now we need to add data: the venue data should be completed here for 77/78
    Attempt to do some venues, and see how long it could take
    With all venue data, we get all weather data

Go back to GODOT
    Grab the songs
    Take measurements for the year

Now we have the 77/78 files, so do the BPM
    Try and do volume as well

6: Make maps of 77/78 tours
7: Make pretty BPM comparisons
8: Make pretty graphs

9: Make website

10: Write article
