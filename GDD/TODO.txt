Order of things to do

*: Finish all years shows
*: Get the venue data for all 77/78 shows

* The JSON output is now done.
    Test when you can, by writing a program that reads a date and outputs a setlist
    This makes it easy to test

* Create the master songs list
    Use it to verify the show data

Create the venues data
    You need to clean this data, likely, so try to clean on the original yaml file to start with
    * Take the venue data with long lat you have so far and merge them
    After cleaning everything, ensure to throw away any unused venues.
        Unlikely, but check anyway - this would be part of the auto checking anyway

Now this all done, tidy the code. Move all the code to merge the 2 pieces of data off the repo (but store and keep)
    We have;
        * a set of files for each year
        * a list of venues
        * a list of songs and writers
        Some scripts to make meta editing and checking palatable

Write code to get weather, first by finding the next show to grab.
    Now we need to add data: the venue data should be completed here for 77/78
    Attempt to do some venues, and see how long it could take
    With all venue data, we get all weather data

Go back to GODOT
    Grab the songs
    Take measurements for the year

Now we have the 77/78 files, so do the BPM
    Try and do volume as well
