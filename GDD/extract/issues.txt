    Particularly messy. The 2 given here slightly agree, radically different from jerrygarcia.com
    Articles mention no setlist!

    Also very messy, much like the above. No idea where jerrybase gets these sets

1970/06/27
    Sort out this mess

1970/07/12
    What is "Tell It To Me?". "Cocaine Blues?"

1970/11/06 + 1970/11/07
    How many shows for both nights? I have followed Jerrybase for this but I am not sure

1971/03/05:
    Do we know anything about the Black Panthers show? (Not added to the DB)

1971/04/13:
    What is a "Darkness Jam" and should it be included?

1978/07/01:
    Is there a Deal in the first set?

1978/11/17:
    First show that evening is an acoustic show. Not added; decide and add manually

1978/12/17:
    Is it Space or Ollin Arageed?

1979/02/07
    Where Jerry does 4 valiums. What's the real setlist?

1981-05-09
    Why does Jerrybase have Twist And Shout / Walking The Dog as a 2nd show?

1981-05-22, Warfield Theatre
    Is this a Grateful Dead show?

1981-10-11
    More obviously not GD; just Jerry + Bobby

1984/07/06:
    Is it an Around and Around, or not?

1984-12-28:
    Down In The Bottom, I Ain't Superstitious - same song?

Check and compare Dark Star vs Dark Star Jam
Check all jams mentioned in the CSV data
Check all space NOT followed by drums
In the early 70s, Jerrybase almost always gives Good Lovin > Drums > Good Lovin
    Do all those Good Lovin's deserve a Drums?
