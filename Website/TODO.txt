    Es ?  Pr 8
1: Add tabs, other tables and Graphs
    Es 14 Pr 8
2: Extract the timings we have, and add them the to real DB
    Es 10 Pr 9
3: Use the real DB to build the binary data. Update the data
    Es 10 Pr 9
4: Look at hosting
    Es 2  Pr 10
5: Check venue data complete
    Es 1  Pr 8
6: Work out how to manipulate the DB tables, and make backups

7: Add weather info and special graph
    Es 7  Pr 5

Future Work:

Start taking timings properly and add to the DB
    Es 12 Pr 7
Sort out the mess that is the repo, and remove propriatary data
    Es 2  Pr 6
Start taking BPM timings and add the to the DB
    Es 5  Pr 6
Split shows up into tours

Generate tour maps to show the tours
    Es 20 Pr 5
Match sources to shows, i.e. each show should have a link to sources
    Es 20 Pr 4
Write code to measure accuratly pitch shift due to sped up setOrderTablePopupList

Done work in 2023:

    * Graphs should also show "average" as a dotted line
    * List rows should be coloured
    * Numbers on charts should only be to 2 d.p.

Changes to the current website:

    Songs should show how common they are ("7th most commonly played")
        Split all songs into bands of equal size: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare, Unique
        Add a tooltip for the meaning of this
    Add "total played" to the "played per year" chart
    "St. Stephen" should get you St Stephen, so allow searches on alternate names
    Clicking on found name in drop-down automatically updates song
        (also when enter is pressed)
    Add a navigation bar to the top
    The scrollbar on list pop-ups needs to reset on a new pop-up
    Add footer with simple about info
    Make all dates hyperlinks
    For average position in show, formulate it as a % position along the show. Place the average set marker as a bar under the position average
        Where there are 3 sets, ignore the whole show

Binary data:
    Extract the current binary data and add the timings
    Bring in new data


Other calculations:
    Must start collecting BPM and add it to the DB.
    This means grabbing ALL the GD. I have a NAS just for this.
    Try and start timing some songs. Just a tour (like spring 78).
        Work out what needs to work


For the year data:
    Show the year, total shows
    Show:
        most common songs
        most common pairings (minus drums > space)
        longest shows
        shortest shows
        longest songs
        shortest songs
        my picks for the year
        most common venues
        hottest shows
        coldest shows
        unique songs
        songs introduced
        songs stopped playing (except uniques)
            (i.e. played this year and never after)
        longest since last played
        Most similar sets
        Most dissimilar sets
        Average show to represent the year

For the song data
    First played
    Last played
    Common into
    Common out of
    Longest
    Shortest
    Average per year
    Average set position

For the about page:
    A page about means
    Be brave and show a photo


For the download page:
    Point to repo, which should have a decent setup by this point
    Download as a CSV file 
    Download as SQL
