How the binary works in the javascript:

1: Get the files
    songs.bin
    shows.bin

2: The data format is unsigned 8-bit array

3: The songs.bin is just an array of strings, null terminated, with an EXTRA 0 byte at the end

4: shows.bin uses 16 bit values, i.e. 2 bytes each
    We traverse the array until we hit a 16-bit zero
    The first 2 bytes are the date, represented as number of days 1st Jan 1950 + days
        (this gives 179 years of possible dates)
    Then follows a set. A set is a list of [song_index, length]
        song_index must be -1 since we cannot store a zero
        length is in seconds
        We keep getting sets until we hit a zero
    Sets are collected until a zero hits, i.e. one show is:

    Date as day offset from 1st Jan 1950, as word
    Array of sets, ending with 0 word
        Set is an array of [song index, length] ending in zero

5: If a word is at index n, then the calculation is
        value = array[index] + (array[index + 1] * 256)
