    Compress the outputted javascript

Hard things:
    The scrollbar on list pop-ups needs to reset on a new pop-up

Other calculations:
    Must start collecting BPM and add it to the DB.
    This means grabbing ALL the GD. I have a NAS just for this.
    Try and start timing some songs. Just a tour (like spring 78).
        Work out the exact workflow to the point of estimating how long this will take.

For the show data:
    Have a "next / previous" show
    Have a "next / previous" for the venue

For the about page:
    A page about means
    Be brave and show a photo

For the download page:
    Point to repo, which should have a decent setup by this point
    Download as a CSV file 
    Download as SQL
