    Es ?  Pr 8
3: Add tabs, other tables and Graphs
    Es 14 Pr 8
4: Look at hosting

    Es 20 Pr 4
Write code to measure accuratly pitch shift due to speed up
    Es 20 Pr 3

Done work in 2023:
    * Graphs should also show "average" as a dotted line
    * List rows should be coloured
    * Numbers on charts should only be to 2 d.p.
    * Add tabs to top of page for show, years etc...
    * Add footer with simple about info
    * Extract the timings we have, and add them the to real DB
    * Use the real DB to build the binary data. Update the data
    * Add venues and weather to the binary files, load in javascript
    * Have a storage object
    * An API
    * Seperate files for all display tabs
    * Extract the current binary data and add the timings
    * Bring in new data
    * Fill the rarest songs columns
    * Finished uniques / first / last played to year
    * Made sure times of 0 are ignored
    * Added the venue information
    * Added the day to the date information
    * Fixed bad header in set information
    * Moved to Visual Studio code
    * Fix the venue information
    * Add Celcius to the weather y axis
    * Put weather in a hash map
    * Added hottest, coldest and wettest shows to year
    * Show the times underneath the songs
    * Added longest songs, longest and shortest shows
    * Sort out uniques
    * Added year tab details
    * Added recommended shows - a curated list with no comments
    * Moved search to upper right, shared on tabs
    * Vertically center text in the middle of card headers
    * Clicking on found name in drop-down automatically updates song
    * Allow for searching on all tabs

Changes to the current website:
    Make all dates, venues and songs hyperlinks
    Thus, make the "back" button work as well
    Years graphs:
        Timeline map of show dates
        Graph of average length of songs over time
    Add date to longest songs
    Add venue tab
    Add about tab
    Add an options tab
    Songs should show how common they are ("7th most commonly played")
    Add "total played" to the "played per year" chart
    "St. Stephen" should get you St Stephen, so allow searches on alternate names
        I.e. add levenstein distance
    Make all links open up the other tabs with the correct information
    Make the system remember where you were last time
    For average position in show, formulate it as a % position along the show. Place the average set marker as a bar under the position average
        Where there are 3 sets, ignore the whole show
    Add unit tests based on modules

Hard things:
    The scrollbar on list pop-ups needs to reset on a new pop-up

Other calculations:
    Must start collecting BPM and add it to the DB.
    This means grabbing ALL the GD. I have a NAS just for this.
    Try and start timing some songs. Just a tour (like spring 78).
        Work out the exact workflow to the point of estimating how long this will take.

For the show data:
    Have a "next / previous" show
    Have a "next / previous" for the venue

For the about page:
    A page about means
    Be brave and show a photo

For the download page:
    Point to repo, which should have a decent setup by this point
    Download as a CSV file 
    Download as SQL
