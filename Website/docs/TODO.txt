Path of Work / Priorities
-------------------------


After analysis, this order:

1: Download all the GD (ongoing - note not every recording, just every show)
3: Add tabs, other tables and Graphs
4: Look at hosting

Future Work:

Start taking timings properly and add to the DB
Start taking BPM timings and add the to the DB
Split shows up into tours
Generate tour maps to show the tours
Match sources to shows, i.e. each show should have a link to sources
Write code to measure accuratly pitch shift due to speed up


2024 TODO start list:

Comment the code so it's a bit easier to understand

Songs:
    * On "Played per year" graph, change "Avg when played" to "Avg from when first played"
    * Add a smoothed line on average length of song (not done, bad choice)
    * In "Last versions" the text should maybe be "X days UNTIL next"
    * In "First versions" and "last versions" the ends should say "last version" and "first version"
    * When the table popup is displayed, unless it is the same as the last one, it should reset the scrollbar
    * In "Average Set Position", the title is "Average Length", so fix
    * In "Average set position", the average line should not have a break in it
    * The footer shouldn't be a box, just a horizontal line
    Average song length per year should skip data points where there is no data
    ?? Add "Most common other songs in same set" and "Most common songs in same show"
    Start a list of shows that have no recordings and add to the database

Shows:
    "Only played this year" should show total times played
    "Never played again" shoud show last time played
    "Only played this year" songs should be in "never played again"??
    "New songs" should show first time played
    "Wettest shows" shows no data
    Hottest and coldest shows should show C with a F switch, or both temperatures
    Have a button for next / previous show

Venues
    There should be a map of the location, obtained from public domain records
    Every show played box should be bigger on the bottom
    Should be a "most common songs" table.
    Should be a "hottest shows"
    Should be a "coldest shows"
    Should be a "wettest shows"
    Should be a timeline showing shows per year
    Should a timeline showing shows in each month

Other stuff:
    Add shows with no setlists (use the original Jerrybase)
    Check with Pauls timings
    Add seque information
    Add tour maps
    Finish Combos page


Done work in 2023:
    * Graphs should also show "average" as a dotted line
    * List rows should be coloured
    * Numbers on charts should only be to 2 d.p.
    * Add tabs to top of page for show, years etc...
    * Add footer with simple about info
    * Extract the timings we have, and add them the to real DB
    * Use the real DB to build the binary data. Update the data
    * Add venues and weather to the binary files, load in javascript
    * Have a storage object
    * An API
    * Seperate files for all display tabs
    * Extract the current binary data and add the timings

    * Added played % per year for combos
    * Added average length graph on combos
    * Added box to allow choices when 2 shows are searched for

Other calculations:
    Must start collecting BPM and add it to the DB.
    This means grabbing ALL the GD. I have a NAS just for this.
    Try and start timing some songs. Just a tour (like spring 78).
        Work out the exact workflow to the point of estimating how long this will take.

For the show data:
    Have a "next / previous" show
    Have a "next / previous" for the venue

For the about page:
    A page about means
    Be brave and show a photo

For the download page:
    Point to repo, which should have a decent setup by this point
    Download as a CSV file 
    Download as SQL
