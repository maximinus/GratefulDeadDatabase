            <p>GDD is yet another attempt to create a database of Grateful Dead shows and sets.
            The data was taken from a number of sources; primarily the tapes themselves, but I also cross-checked against Deadbase, https://www.setlists.net/, https://jerrybase.com/, https://github.com/jefmsmit/gdshowsdb.
            Timings were data-mined from archive.org.

            All data here is public domain, and the complete database itself can be found on the "downloads" tab.</p>

            <h5>What's Missing</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Shows with no setlists are currently not in the database.</li>
                <li>Some timings are missing.</li>
                <li>The segues are mostly missing.</li>
              </ul> 
            <h5>What's To Come</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The timings will be completed.</li>
                <li>The segue information will be added.</li>
                <li>Beats Per Minute (BPM) as a running average will be added.</li>
                <li>List of musical guests will be added.</li>
                <li>Maps of all tours.</li>
                <li>A page allowing you to search for shows with extreme fine-tuning.</li>
                <li>The weather data will include wind speed, snow, sunrise and sunset times.</li>
              </ul>
